<p>This month marks Ownedge’s 15th anniversary, which means I started working as an independent professional (aka freelancer) 15 years ago.</p>

<p>So far, so good. I’m enjoying the journey and looking forward to the challenges ahead. I want to keep learning and growing as much as possible.</p>

<p>Over the past few months, I’ve been exploring and leveraging AI to bring ideas to life so quickly that sometimes it feels a bit unreal.</p>

<p>It’s crucial to know what good software is really about: being able to select the best solutions and, maybe most importantly, to reject what isn’t good enough, even if it “works.”</p>

<p>But once you figure out how to trust it, how to “talk” with it and get the expected results, you realize that the real magic shows up when you add what it actually misses.</p>

<p>Intent. Taste. Ownership.</p>

<p>In these 15 years, I’ve never really had a website for Ownedge. But somewhere between Christmas and the New Year, I had some fun building something a bit different from the usual. The ingredients are simple: terminals, retro aesthetics, and nostalgia, what else would you expect from me?</p>

<p>It’s mostly a fun design exercise, I don’t really need a website, but I hope it teleports you back to a time when computers and the internet truly felt like a window to the world.</p>

<p>Feel free to sign the guestbook, there's also a blog and, if someone else is online, maybe even chat a bit in the very basic IRC channel.</p>

<p>Enjoy all the little details, and try to find the easter eggs.</p>

<p>It’s still January, so have a great 2026.</p>
