<p>This month marks Ownedge’s 15th anniversary, which means I started working as an independent professional (aka freelancer) 15 years ago.</p>

<p>So far, so good. I’m enjoying the journey and looking forward to the challenges ahead as I want to keep learning and exploring what triggers my curiosity.</p>

<p>Over the past few months, I’ve been diving into and leveraging AI to bring ideas to life so quickly that sometimes it feels a bit unreal.</p>

<p>You really need to be able to look at what it throws at you, know what to keep, and maybe most importantly, what to reject when it isn’t good enough, even if it “works”.</p>

<p>But once you figure out how to trust it, how to speak its language and get the expected results, you realise that the real magic shows up when you add what it actually misses.</p>

<p>Things such as vision, intent, experience, taste, can't really be delegated to AI (yet).</p>

<p>Fun fact: in 15 years, Ownedge never really had a website but somewhere between the end of last year and the beginning of the new one, I decided to change that.</p>

<p>This was mostly a design exercise, I didn't really need a website, but I think it came out pretty cool, even if weird and anti-standard.</p>

<p>Feel free to sign the guestbook, there's also a blog and, if someone else is "online", maybe even chat a bit in the very basic IRC channel.</p>

<p>Enjoy all the little details, and try to find the easter eggs.</p>
