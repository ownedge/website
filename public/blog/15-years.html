<p>This month marks Ownedge’s 15th anniversary — which means I started working as an independent professional (aka freelancer) 15 years ago.</p>

<p>So far, so good. I’m enjoying the journey and looking forward to the challenges ahead, as I want to keep learning and growing as much as possible.</p>

<p>Over the past few months, I’ve been exploring and leveraging AI to bring ideas to life so quickly that it sometimes feels a bit unreal.</p>

<p>I guess many of you feel this too: once you figure out ways to trust it — how to write the right prompts and get the expected results — you realize that the real magic shows up when you add what it actually misses.</p>

<p>Vision. Personality. Taste.</p>

<p>And of course, knowing what good software is about, being able to select what’s good but, maybe most importantly, being able to reject what's not good enough, even if it “works”.</p>

<p>In these 15 years, I’ve never really had a website for Ownedge, but somewhere between Christmas and the New Year, I had some fun building something a bit different from the usual.</p>
    
<p>The ingredients are simple: terminals, retro aesthetics, and nostalgia — what else would you expect from me?</p>

<p>I hope it teleports you too, back to a time when computers and the internet really felt like a window to the world.</p>

<p>Feel free to sign the guestbook — and if someone else is online, maybe even chat a bit in the very basic IRC channel. 🙂</p>

<p>Enjoy all the little details, and try to find the easter eggs.</p>

<p>Have a great 2026.</p>
