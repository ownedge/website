  <h2>The Intersection of Brutalism and UI</h2>
  <div class="meta">March 15, 2024</div>
  
  <p>In a world of rounded corners and soft shadows, we choose the raw integrity of the grid. Digital brutalism isn't just an aesthetic; it's a rejection of the superfluous.</p>
  
  <p>When we designed Ownedge, we looked back to the terminal interfaces of the 80s and 90s. Not for nostalgia, but for their efficiency. They respected the user's intelligence.</p>

  <h3>Core Principles</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Function over decoration</li>
    <li>High contrast for clarity</li>
    <li>Response times measured in milliseconds</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>This path allows us to build tools that feel like extensions of the mind, not just apps on a screen.</p>
